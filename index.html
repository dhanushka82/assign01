<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p><font size="4">
studying IT always have been one of my dreams in education with development  of technology. It has become an unavoidable factor in our day today life. Although I can not back date an exact time period for developing my interest in IT. There are number of reason for interest of IT.
<ul>
 1. Job availability 
</ul><p>
Information technology has been involved in almost every industry for somehow. If we consider transport and aviation, agricultural, sports, banking, law, human resources ect. Therefore plenty of jobs are being created day by day while other jobs  market is shrinking.

</p>
<ul>
 2. Freedom, flexibility and able to work remotely 
</ul><p>
No matter where you go there will be a job opportunity for IT workers. It doesn't depends on social or cultural. Furthermore if you want to go somewhere with your friends or family there is a possibility to enjoy your trip while you are working if you can do your job remotely. There are plenty of information technology jobs what you can with just laptop and internet connection.

</p>
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4">
The influence of my friends within my comfort zone can be consider as a turning point. Most of my friends are engaged in IT field and everyone is enjoying their career while enjoying their life. They find enough freedom in their life nobody is stuck with scheduled work. Thus according to my point of view information technology opens the door for vast area of jobs and the very notion of job opportunities makes me motivated for my studies in IT.

Although there are number of universities around me RMIT was always my favourite, I always believe that the education is a right and high quality. Study in RMIT is a privilege so I have a right to enjoy my privileges in RMIT with my rightful education. Australian university by ranking is another fact which made my way to RMIT. Thus I strongly believe that my decision to study at RMIT is one of the best decision I ever made in my life. I expect to improve my learning skills and sharpen my current skills while moulding my personal traits according to job market in Australia.
